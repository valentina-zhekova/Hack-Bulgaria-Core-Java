to do:
- Cars, Pair and Time are old versions, look them again
- there was some tricky part with Time, but what exactly?
- a little awkward StackImpl... refactor it later;
  should toString() and length() be destructive?
- tasks 6 and 7: double linked list similar to above
  but there is factory method in 7*
- Matrix***:
  POJO Pixel?
  Matrix: operate(MO op): calls withPixel
  MO: Pixel withPixel(x, y, ...)
  ... what calls what?
- bonus calculator: interesting task, jar
