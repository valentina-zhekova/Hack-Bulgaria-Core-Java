to do:
- interface extends ... with defaults?
- tests: setup function
- Map<Double, Long> to Map<Double, Integer> ?
- orderByAsc/Desc: the comparator is so or there is more beautiful way?
- when obj -> use methods and when Class::method?

- cascading lambda functions
- orderByAsc/Desc: the comparator is so or there is more beautiful way?
- getStudentsWithLowest/HighestMarks: ugly & slow; look skip() function
- getEmailToheader: maybe not working properly
- last two tasks
