to do:
- Atomic Integer with Lock:
  - should fields be final => immutable class => methods' types - void?
  - try / fianlly / return issue where is the point
  - seems if (lock.tryLock()) {lock / do / unlock} is wrong
    lock / do / unlock just works fine, but why?
  - what's the point in lazy set; actually what's the difference with int set() ?
  - also: weakCompareAndSet() vs compareAndSet() ?
